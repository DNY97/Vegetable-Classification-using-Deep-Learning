# Vegetable-Classification-using-Deep-Learning


This project aims to classify images of vegetables into three categories: tomato, potato, and brinjal (eggplant). It utilizes deep learning techniques to train a model on a dataset of labeled vegetable images. The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and trained on the dataset to learn the distinguishing features of each vegetable class.
